# Source-Cycle-Chat-Bind-Maker
Lets you focus on actually typing out your chat bind rather than writing aliases. Thanks source

I made this at 4 AM and i have no regrets

Don't forget to reference the first alias at the end or else it won't loop

Oh and also using the symbol " can break your entire bind making it stuck on one line, so try to avoid using that
