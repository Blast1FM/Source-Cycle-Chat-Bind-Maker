# Source-Cycle-Chat-Bind-Maker
Lets you focus on actually typing out your chat bind rather than writing aliases. Thanks source

Generates a file with just your lines as well. That file is purged on script restart 

I made this at 4 AM and i have no regrets

Oh and also using the symbol " can break your entire bind making it stuck on one line, so try to avoid using that
